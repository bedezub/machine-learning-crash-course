# Machine Learning Crash Course

Hi! This is literally a brain dump for me. 

I have been following [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) for quite some time... 2019 to be exact! 

However, I didn't have time to complete the course lol. 

So yeah, here am I once again. Hopefully I did manage to complete it tho. Maybe somewhere in the future, if I managed to become a Data Scientist. This repo would be a good reference for a refresher!
